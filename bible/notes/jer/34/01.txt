\v 1 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came with the armies of all the kingdoms that he ruled, and they fought against Jerusalem and the other towns in Judah. At that time, Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 2 "Go to Zedekiah the King of Judah, and say to him, 'This is what Yahweh, the God whom we Israelites \add worship\add*, says: "I am about to enable the army of the king of Babylon to capture this city, and they will burn it down.
\v 3 You will not escape from them; they will capture you and take you to the king of Babylon. And then they will take you to Babylon."~'

\c 34
\p
\v 1 This is the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh. This word came when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all of his army, together with all the kingdoms of the earth, 
the domains under his power, and all their people were waging war against Jerusalem and all of her cities. This word said,
\v 2 â€œYahweh, God of Israel, says this: 'Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him, "Yahweh says this: Look, I am about to give this city over into 
the hand of the king of Babylon. He will burn it.
\v 3 You will not escape from his hand, for you will certainly be seized and given into his hand. Your eyes will look on the eyes of the 
king of Babylon and his mouth will speak words with your mouth when you go to Babylon.'
