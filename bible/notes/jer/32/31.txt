Yahweh continues speaking to Jeremiah.

  * **For this city has been a provocation of my wrath and fury since the day that they built it. It has been that right up to this present day.**  - The words "wrath" and "fury" mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "For the people of Jerusalem have made me very angry since the day they built their city until today." (See: [[:ur:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet|Doublet]] and [[:ur:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]])
  * **from before my face**  - AT: "from my presence" or "completely" (See: [[:ur:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
