====== Jeremiah 16:5-6 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 This is also what Yahweh said to me: "Do not go to funerals to mourn or to show \add those whose relatives have died\add* that you feel sorry for them, because I have stopped protecting them, and I have caused that things will not go well for them. I have stopped faithfully loving them and acting mercifully toward them.
\v 6 \add Very many people\add* will die in this land, including those who are important and those who are not important. And no one will mourn for them, or even bury \add their corpses\add*. No one will cut himself or shave his head \add to show that he is very sad\add*.

\v 5 For Yahweh says this: "Do not enter any house where there is mourning. Do not go about lamenting, and do not sympathize for these people. For I have gathered up my peace, covenant faithfulness,
 and acts of tender mercy, from this people!" This is Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 6 "So the great and the small will die in this land. They will not be buried, nor will anyone mourn for them. No one will cut themselves or shave their heads for them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I have gathered up my peace, covenant faithfulness, and acts of tender mercy** - Yahweh gather different ways he has blessed the people of Israel to mean he will not bless the people of Israel anymore. (See: [[:ur:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh's declaration**  - See how you translated this in [[ur:bible:notes:jer:01:07|1:8]].
  * **the great and the small**  - This refers to all kinds of people and uses size to refer to how important they are.  Either great importance or small importance.  (See: [[:ur:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
  * **nor will anyone mourn for them. No one will cut themselves or shave their heads for them** - These two [sentences/phrases] have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See” Parallelism) AT: "No one will mourn for them in any way."
  * **cut themselves or shave their heads for them** - These are customs the people used to show they were very sad. (See: [[:ur:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
