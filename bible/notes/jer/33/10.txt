\v 10 Yahweh says this: "In this place about which you are now saying, 'It is desolate. There is neither man nor beast in the cities of Judah, and the streets of Jerusalem are uninhabited, with neither man nor beast 

\v 11 —again there will be heard here sounds of rejoicing and celebration, sounds of bridegrooms and brides, sounds of people who say, "Give thanks to Yahweh of hosts, for he is good, and his covenant faithfulness is unending." Bring an offering of thanksgiving to my house, for I will restore the fortunes of the land as in the beginning,'” says Yahweh.
