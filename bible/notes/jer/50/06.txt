\v 6 My people have been a lost flock. Their shepherds have led them astray in the mountains;
\q they have turned them around from hill to hill. They went, they forgot the place where they had lived.
\q
\v 7 Everyone who went out to them devoured them. Their adversaries said, ‘We are not guilty, 
\q because they sinned against Yahweh, their true home—Yahweh, the hope of their ancestors.’
