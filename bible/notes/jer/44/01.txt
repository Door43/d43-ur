<usfm>
\v 1 This is the message that Yahweh gave me concerning the Jews who were living in \add northern\add* Egypt—in Migdol, Tahpenes, and Memphis \add cities\add*, and in the Pathros \add region in southern Egypt\add*:
\v 2 "This is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom you Israelites \add say you belong to\add*, say: You saw the disaster that I caused the people in Jerusalem and the other towns in Judah to experience. Those towns are now ruined and deserted.
\v 3 That happened because I was extremely angry with them on account of their being very wicked. They burned incense to other gods and worshiped them. They were gods that you previously did not know about, and your ancestors also did not know about them.

\v 1 This is the message that Yahweh gave me concerning the Judeans who were living in northern Egypt—in Migdol, Tachpanches, and Memphis—and in the region of Pathros in southern Egypt:
\v 2 "This is what I, Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, the God whom Israel worships, say: You saw the disaster that I caused the people in Jerusalem and the other towns in Judah to experience. Those towns are now ruined and deserted.
\v 3 That happened because I was extremely angry with them on account of their being very wicked. They burned incense to other gods and worshiped them. They were gods that you previously did not know about, and your ancestors also did not know about them.

\c 44
\p
\v 1 This was the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Judeans who lived in the land of Egypt, the ones staying in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and in the land of Patros.
\v 2 “Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: 'You yourselves have seen all the disasters that I brought on Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah. See, they are ruins today; there is no one to live in them.
\v 3 This is because of the wicked things they did to offend me by going to burn incense and to worship other gods. These were gods that neither they themselves, nor you, nor your ancestors knew.
