====== Jeremiah 13:8-11 ======

\v 8 Then Yahweh gave me this message:
\v 9 "\add What happened to your waistcloth\add* shows that I will destroy the things that the people of Jerusalem and \add other places in\add* Judah are very proud of.
\v 10 Those wicked people refuse to pay attention to what I say. They stubbornly do just what they desire to do; they worship other gods. Therefore, they will become completely useless, like your waistcloth.
\v 11 Just like a waistcloth clings closely\f + \ft Or: tightly \f* to a man's waist, I wanted the people \f + \ft metonymy \f* of Israel and Judah to cling closely to me. I wanted them to be my people, people who would praise me and honor me. But they would not pay attention to me.

\v 8 Then the word of Yahweh came to me again and said,
\v 9 "Yahweh says this: 'In the same way I will destroy the great arrogance of Judah and Jerusalem.
\v 10 This wicked people who refuses to listen to my word, who walk in the hardness of their heart, who go after other gods to worship them and bow down to them—they will be like this undergarment 
that is good for nothing.
\v 11 For just as an undergarment clings to someone's hips, so I have made all the house of Israel and all the house of Judah cling to me'—this is Yahweh’s declaration—to be my people, to bring me fame, praise, and honor. But they would not listen to me.'
