<usfm>
\q
\v 25 This is what I have given to you, the portion I have decreed for you—this is Yahweh’s declaration—
\q because you have forgotten me and trusted in deceit.
\q
\v 26 So also I myself will strip your skirts off you, and your private parts will be seen.
\q
\v 27 Your adultery and neighing, the shamefulness of your promiscuous behavior on the hills and in the fields! I will cause them to be seen,
\q these detestable things!  Woe to you, Jerusalem! You have not been clean. How long will this continue?
</usfm>
