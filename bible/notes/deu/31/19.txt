\v 19 Now therefore write this song for yourself and teach it to the people of Israel. Put it in their mouths, so that this song may be a witness for me against the people of Israel.
\v 20 For when I will have brought them into the land that I swore to give to their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey, and when they will have eaten and become satisfied and fat, then they will turn to other gods and worship them; they will despise me and break my covenant.
