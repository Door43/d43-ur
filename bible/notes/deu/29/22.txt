\v 22 The generation to come, your children who will rise up after you, and the foreigner who comes from a distant  land, will speak, when they see the plagues on this land and the diseases with which Yahweh has made it sick—
\v 23 and when they see that the whole land has become sulfur and burning salt, where nothing is sown nor bears fruit, where no vegetation grows, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, that Yahweh destroyed in his anger and wrath—
\v 24 they will say together with all the other nations, ‘Why has Yahweh done this to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?’
