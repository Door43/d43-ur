\v 5 Afterward David’s heart afflicted him because he had cut a corner off Saul’s robe.
\v 6 He said to his men, "May Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, Yahweh’s anointed, to put out my hand against him, seeing he is Yahweh’s anointed."
\v 7 So David rebuked his men with these words, and did not permit them to attack Saul. Saul stood up, left the cave, and went on his way.
