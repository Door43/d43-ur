\v 17 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron. He said,
\v 18 "Do not allow the Kohathite tribal clans to be removed from among the Levites.
\v 19 Protect them, that they may live and not die, by doing this. When they approach the most holy things 
\v 20 they must not go in to see the sanctuary even for a moment, or they must die. Aaron and his sons must go in, and then Aaron and his sons must assign each of Kohathites to his work and to his special tasks."
