\v 6 Yahweh said, "Now listen to my words.  
\q When a prophet of mine is with you, 
\q2 I will reveal myself to him in visions  
\q2 and speak to him in dreams.
\v 7 My servant Moses is not like that. 
\q He is faithful in all my house.
\v 8 I speak to Moses directly, not with visions or riddles. 
\q He sees my form. 
\q So why are you unafraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?"
