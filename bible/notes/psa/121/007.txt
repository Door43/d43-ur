  * **from all evil** - AT: "from all evil things" or "from being harmed" (See: [[:ur:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh will protect you from all evil; he will keep your soul. Yahweh will protect you in all you do** - These three clauses have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See‚Äù Parallelism)
