===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Why are you discouraged, my soul?**  - The author refers to himself as "my soul". The author speaks to himself as if he were speaking to another person. (See: [[:ur:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
  * **he is the help of my face and my God**  - The author refers to himself as "my face". AT: "he is my help and he is my God" (See: [[:ur:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]]) Also, this is written as two phases so that it has a stronger meaning. If necessary they can be combined. AT: "he is my helpful God" (See: [[:ur:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys|Hendiadys]])
