====== Psalms 127:1-2 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 If people are building a house without \add knowing whether\add* it is Yahweh's \add will to build it\add*,
\q2 they are building it in vain.
\q1 Similarly, if Yahweh does not protect a city,
\q2 it is useless for guards\f + \ft Or: sentries \f* to stay awake \add to tell people if their enemies come to attack it\add*.
\q1
\v 2 It is also useless to arise very early and go to sleep late at night
\q2 in order that you can work hard \add all day\add* to \add earn money to buy\add* food,
\q1 because Yahweh gives food to those whom he loves.
\b
\q1

\v 1 Unless Yahweh builds the house,
\q they work uselessly, those who build it.
\q Unless Yahweh guards the city,
\q the watchman stands guard uselessly.
\q
\v 2 It is useless for you to rise up early,
\q to come home late,
\q or to eat the bread of hard work,
\q for Yahweh gives his beloved sleep.
