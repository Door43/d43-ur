\v 29 But Jehu did not leave the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, by which he made Israel sinâ€”that is, the worship of the golden calves in Bethel and Dan.
\v 30 So Yahweh said to Jehu, "Because you have done well in executing what was right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab and you did all that was in my heart, your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation."
\v 31 But Jehu took no care to walk in the law of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, by which he made Israel sin.
