\v 18 So when Zimri saw that the city had been taken, he went into the fortress attached to the kingâ€™s palace and set fire to the building over him; in this way he died in the flames. 
\v 19 This was for the sins that he had committed in doing what was evil in the sight of Yahweh, by walking in the way of Jeroboam and in the sin that he had committed, so as to lead Israel to sin.
\v 20 As for the other matters concerning Zimri, and the treason that he carried out, are they not written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Israel?
