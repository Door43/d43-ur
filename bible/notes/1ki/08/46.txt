<usfm>
\v 46 \add It is true that\add* everyone sins \f + \ft litotes \f*. So, if your people sin against you, and you become angry with them, you may allow their enemies to defeat them and capture them and take them away to their enemies' country, even to countries that are far away.
\v 47 If that happens, while they are in those countries to which they were forced to go, if they sincerely repent and plead with you there saying 'We have sinned and have done things that are very wicked \f + \ft doublet \f*,'

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 46 It is true that everyone sins. So, suppose that your people sin against you and that you become angry with them. You might allow their enemies to defeat them, capture them, and take them away to their own countries, even to countries that are far away.
\v 47 And suppose that, while your people are in those countries to which they had to go, they sincerely repent and plead with you there saying, 'We have sinned and have done things that are very wicked.'
</usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p
\v 46 Suppose that they sin against youâ€”since  there is no one who does not sin, and suppose that you are angry with them and hand them over to the enemy, so that the enemy carries them away captive to their land, whether distant or near.
\v 47 Then suppose that they realize they are in the land where they have been exiled, and suppose that they repent and seek favor from you from the land of their captors. Suppose that they say, 'We have acted perversely and sinned. We have behaved wickedly.'
