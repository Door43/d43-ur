      * **Zilpah** - See how you translated this name in [[ur:bible:notes:gen:29:23|29:24]].
      * **who were born to him in Paddanaram** - It is implied that this does not include Benjamin who was born in the land of Canaan near Bethlehem. It only mentions Paddanaram since that is where most of them were born. Alternate translation: "who were born to him in Paddanaram, except Benjamin who was born in the land of Canaan." (See: [[ur:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
      * **Mamre** - See how you translated this in [[ur:bible:notes:gen:13:16|13:18]].
