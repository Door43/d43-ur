====== Ecclesiastes 06:11-12 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 The more that we talk,
\q2 the more often we say things that are senseless,
\q2 so it certainly does not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* benefit us to talk a lot.
\p
\v 12 We live for only a short time; we disappear like \f + \ft simile \f* a shadow disappears \add in the sunlight\add*. No one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* knows what is best for us while we are alive, and no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* knows what will happen to us after we die \f + \ft euphemism \f*.

<usfm>
\v 11 The more that we talk,
\q2 the more often we say things that are senseless,
\q2 so it certainly does not benefit us to talk a lot.
\p
\v 12 No human being can know everything that is good for himself in this life. People live for a few seemingly meaningless days. Life passes by quickly, like a shadow, and no one know what is coming after we die. We live for only a short time, and then we disappear like a vapor.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q1 
\v 11 The more words that are spoken, the more futility increases, 
\q2 so what advantage is that to a man?
\v 12 For who knows what is good for man in his life during his futile, numbered days through which he passes like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will come under the sun after he passes?
