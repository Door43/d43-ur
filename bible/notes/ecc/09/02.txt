<usfm>
\v 2 Everyone has the same fate. The same fate awaits
\q1 the righteous and the wicked, 
\q1 the good and the bad, 
\q1 the clean and the unclean, 
\q1 and the who sacrifices and the one who does not sacrifice. 
As the good will die, 
\q1 so also will the sinner.
As the one who swears will die,
\q1 so also will the man who fears to make an oath.
