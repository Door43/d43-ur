<usfm>
\v 3 Then they will say, 'It is because we did not revere Yahweh
\q2 that we no longer have a king.
\q1 But \add even if we had\add* a king,
\q2 he certainly could not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* do anything to help us.'
\q1
\v 4 They falsely promise \add that they will do many things\add*;
\q2 they solemnly promise and make agreements
\q2 but they do not do what they promise.
\q1 So people accuse and sue each other in the courts;
\q2 they are like \f + \ft simile \f* poisonous weeds that grow in a plowed field.

\v 3 They say, "We have no king now because we did not honor or respect Yahweh.
\q2 But even if we had a king,
\q2 how could a king help us?"
\q1
\v 4 The people of Israel make lying promises and false covenants; 
\q2 and because their promises are not kept, 
\q1 their sort of justice kills people, as poisonous weeds in a field would do.

  * **And a king—what could he do for us?** - The writer uses this question to imply that even if Israel had a king, it would do them no good because they have turned away from Yahweh (their true king) and worshiped idols. (See: [[:ur:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **They speak empty words** - This means that what they say cannot be trusted. (See: [[:ur:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
