\v 1 Then the word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\v 2 “Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Your heart is arrogant! You have said, “I am a god! I will sit in the seat of the gods in the heart of the seas!” Even though you are a man and not God, you make your heart like the heart of a god;
\v 3 you think that you are wiser than Daniel, and that no secret amazes you!
