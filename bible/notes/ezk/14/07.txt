\v 7 When any of you Israelite people or any foreigner living among you turns away from me and starts worshiping idols [IDI] that induce him to sin, and then goes to a prophet to find out what I want him to do, I myself will answer him.
\v 8 I will show that I detest him, and cause \add what happens to\add* him to be a warning to others, and cause him to be someone whom people despise. I will cause him to longer be allowed to associate with my people. Then you will know that I, Yahweh, \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.

\v 7 For every one from the house of Israel and every one of the foreigners staying in Israel who deserts me, who takes his idols 
into his heart and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his own face, and who then comes to a prophet to seek meâ€”I, Yahweh,  
will answer him myself!
\v 8 So I will set my face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb, for I will cut him off from the midst of my people; 
and you will know that I am Yahweh!
