\v 19 You must present to the priests a young bull to be an offering to cause the altar to be acceptable to me. The priests are descendants of Levi, from the clan of Zadok, who come near to the altar to serve me.

\v 18 Next he said to me, “Son of man, the Lord Yahweh says this: These are the regulations for the altar on the day they make it, for raising the burnt offering onto it, and for sprinkling blood on it.
\v 19 You will give a bull from the cattle as a sin offering for the Levitical priests who are the descendants of Zadok, those who come near to me to serve me." This is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.

  * **regulations** - "rules" or "instructions"
  * **You will** - The word "you" is singular. When giving commands and instructions, Yahweh often uses the second person. Yahweh does not specifically say who he is talking about when he says "you."
