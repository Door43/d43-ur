\v 42 You must make them linen undergarments to cover their private parts, undergarments that will cover them from the waist to the thighs.
\v 43 Aaron and his sons must wear these when they enter the tent of meeting or when they approach  the altar to serve in the holy place. They must do this so that they may bear no iniquity and die. This will be a permanent law for Aaron and his descendants after him.
