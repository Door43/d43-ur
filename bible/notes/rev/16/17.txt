\v 17 The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air. Then a loud voice came out of the most holy place and from the throne, saying, "It is done!"
\v 18 There were flashes of lightning, rumbles, crashes of thunder, and a terrible earthquakeâ€”an earthquake greater than any that has ever happened since human beings have been on the earth, so great was this earthquake.
\v 19 The great city was split into three parts, and the nations' cities collapsed. Then God called to mind Babylon the great, and he gave that city the cup filled with the wine made from his furious wrath.
