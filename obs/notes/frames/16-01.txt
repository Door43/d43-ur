==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **and did not drive out** – This tells how they disobeyed God, so in some languages it may be better to start this as a new sentence, "They did not."
  * **drive out the rest of the Canaanites** - This can be translated, "fight with the rest of the Canaanites to force them to leave the land."
  * **or obey God's laws** - This means that the people also disobeyed the laws that God gave to the Israelites at Mount Sinai.
  * **the true God** - That is, "the only real God." Yahweh is the only one that people should worship.
  * **what they thought was right for them** – This means that they all did whatever they wanted to do, including many evil things.
