Every Egyptian firstborn male died, from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of Pharaoh. There was much weeping in Egypt.

That same night, Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Take the Israelites and leave Egypt immediately!” The Egyptian people also urged the Israelites to leave right away.
